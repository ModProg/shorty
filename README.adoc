|===

== Examples

You can run `shorty` with `docker` or `podman`:

```sh
podman run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/modprog/shorty
```
or
```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/modprog/shorty
```

To set all configurable options:

```sh
podman run -p 8000:8000 \
  --env WORDED_LENGTH=1 --env CHARED_LENGTH=4 --env BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/ \
  ghcr.io/modprog/shorty
```

To shorten a URL make a `POST` request:

Using the wordlist:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/w -d https://togglebit.io/posts/terminal-game-jam/
```

Using random characters:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/c -d https://togglebit.io/posts/terminal-game-jam/
```

Afterwards just open the returned URL in a browser of your choice.
